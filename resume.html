        I <strong>love</strong> building products.
      </div>

      <p>I'm a really happy dude who loves working with other happy people to build really
        happy things.

      <p>I got into graphic design, illustration, animation, and video production
        in high school. Shortly after I dropped out of college to start working
        full-time, while teaching myself how to make games and build products after hours.
        I'm still figuring that out to this day, and I'm having a blast doing it.

      <p>I'm obscenely grateful that I got a chance to find my calling and do what
        I love for a living.

            Currently helping to grow Hired by building features, assisting in
            internal tools, and leading the front-end efforts at Hired, often
            prototyping experiences and collaborating with design and product

            <p>My time so far at Hired has involved working and learning from a ton
            of brilliant and genuinelly great folks. I throughly enjoy
            gaining context on our business and actively try to lead efforts with
            both the engineering and business ops team to bring Hired to the scale
            it deserves. We spent the majority of our lives working, and I genuinelly
            love what I do. As a result, I connect deeply with the mission of Hired
            - trying to put everyone in a job they love.

            <p>I'm currently gaining more experience with the Rails stack, with exposure
            to more features that cross the stack, while taking the lead on documenting
            and extending our proprietary CSS framework, assisting with design, and
            prototyping features and internal services.

            Contract software development work via Teksystems for a project
            controls software company in Folsom, CA utilizing Node, .NET
            Javascript, and Ruby on a variety of different projects and
            platforms for clients like Disney, Westfield, and GSA.
          </div>
          <div class="job-entry__deepsummary">
            <p>Runding was my first professional software engineering gig working
            with a team bigger than a couple people. We were building a front-end
            interface for old and antiquated back-end systems with Node using
            websockets (largely in vanilla javascript). I'm still far from a
            javascript expert, but I got a chance to learn a ton about the language
            from designing and building components for our proproietary framework.
            Roughly the last half of my tenure here was on the Disney Imagineering team,
            where we were duplicating complex business logic and I discovered
            how painful it was to share a codebase without any construct for
            automated testing.

            <p>After my Teksystems contract ended, I had planned on continuing my
            work with Runding as a diret hired until I received an offer from Hired.

            Performed a wide range of tasks including technical support and

            with development teams for production support and software enhancements

          <div class="job-entry__deepsummary">
            <p>I began working with Nightingale through an acquisition of a
              web-based medical billing software that I provided support for.
              I got a chance to work with a lot of great people, and gained some
              great experience interfacing directly with customers while supporting
              the product. During my time here, I started teaching myself web
              development technologies and was able to begin automating more of
              our support infastructure.
            <p>Having talked and cooresponded to so many users of our product, I
              inadvertently gained a lot of context on common user experience issues
              and learned how valuable it is to close the gap of communication between
              customer-facing teams and those developing a product.
            <p>In addition, I learned how valuable it was for business to built
              and prioritize hard to duplicate (and often annoying to build) features.
              Much of the medical billing/electronic medical software industry is protected
              by moats of knowledge involving seemingly complex insurance rules and interfaces.
              As a result, I believe the industry is still technologically immature due to the lack
              of competition in the space and reliance on old antiquated systems.

      <h2 class="section-header">Philosophy</h2>
      <h3 class="section-subheader">Tech</h2>
      <p>As fun as it is to learn cutting edge new frameworks and build complicated systems,
        I've come to fall in love with simplistic designs and patterns. In the end, users
        don't care what libraries you're using or how complicated your architecture is - they just
        know if a product works well. The cognitive load required coming to a complex codebase/feature
        should be a heavy consideration to growing teams.
      <p><strong>I'd rather a hundred developers be able to read the code I've
        left behind than impress the two that can.</strong>

      <h3 class="section-subheader" style="margin-top:2.5rem;">Personal</h2>
      <p>I'm far from perfect, and the great thing about this industry is that
        you'll never stop learning. As a result, I think compassion is a key
        component of team interactivity. I strive to teach and learn without
        ego, and believe a person can provide massive contributions to a team
        outside of technical expertise.
      <p><strong>A smile goes a long way.</strong>
      <p>There's always more to learn and more to do.
