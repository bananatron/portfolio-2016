I'll be completely honest with you - I came home drunk last night and rebuilt my portfolio because the old one had been bothering me for so long and apparently that's my productive alternative to drunk texting ex girlfriends. I woke up this morning in a panic for fear of what I had put online, but it actually turned out ok.
